- Hardware Controllers : This Subsystem is comprised of all the possible physical devices in a linux 
installation - CPU , Memory Hardware , Hard Disks 

- Linux kernel : The kernel abstracts and mediates access to  the hardware resources , including the CPU
a kernel is core of operating system 

- O/S Servives : These are services that are typically considered part of the operating 
system (e.g. windowing sysem , command shell )  

- User Applications: The set of applications in use on a particular linux sysem (eg web browser)

- Process Scheduler (SCHED) : To provide control , fair access of CPU to process , while 
interacting with HW on time 

- Memory Manager (MM) : To access system memory , securely and efficiently by multiple 
  processes. Supports Virtual Memory in case of huge memory requirement 

- Virtual File System (VFS): Abstracts the details of the variety of hardware devices by 
  presenting a common file interface to all devices 

- Network Interface (NET): Provides access to several networking standards 
and a variety of network hardware 

- Inter Process Commmunication (IPC) : Supports Several Mechanisms for 
Process-to-Process Communication on a Single Linux System
