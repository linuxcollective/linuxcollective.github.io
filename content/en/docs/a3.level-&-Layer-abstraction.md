- Using abstraction to split computing systems into components makes things easier to understand, but it doesn’t work without organization.

- We arrange components into layers or levels, classifications (or groupings) of components according to where the components sit between the user and the hardware. Web browsers, games, and such sit at the top layer; at the bottom layer we have the memory in the computer hardware—the 0s and 1s. The operating system occupies many of the layers in between.  A Linux system has three main levels.

shows these levels and some of the components inside each level. The hardware is at the base. Hardware includes the memory as well as one or more central processing units (CPUs) to perform computation and to read from and write to memory. Devices such as disks and network interfaces are also part of the hardware. The next level up is the kernel, which is the core of the operating system. The kernel is software residing in memory that tells the CPU where to look for its next task. Acting as a mediator, the kernel manages the hardware (especially main memory) and is the primary interface between the hardware and any running program. Processes—the running programs that the kernel manages—collectively make up the system’s upper level, called user space. (A more specific term for process is user process, regardless of whether a user directly interacts with the process. For example, all web servers run as user processes.)
